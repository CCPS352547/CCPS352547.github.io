    <h1>about me</h1>
    <p>what I'm working towards in my personal life would be working out and becoming really strong strong with amazing muscle definition like Chris Bumsted. 
I am working towards my goal by cutting down on sugars and eating heathier. Another thing I do is work out 6 days out of the week.
The values I consider most necessary for my success would have to be a strong mindset to never give up because I have wanted to multiple times but I realized I'd rather suffer physical pain well working out instead of suffering the physical pain of being fat and sluggish.
A short-term goal I want to work for is making sure I can get a job to save for a car so I can drive to the gym. Another short term goal I'm working on would be making my diet healthier so I can turn all that energy into muscle power and live longer then the life I would if I stayed on my old path.
The character traits and achievements I most want to be know for is the determination to do what it takes to accomplish something no one thought I could and the determination to never give up on something even when It gets hard.</p>
